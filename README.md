# Wafer-Point-Example

This repository contains code for a program which plots points on a simulated 300 unit wafer in a ring along 8 slices.
User should input a number of points to plot corresponding to (8n+1) where n is the number of rings generated.
The program will output a list of coordinates and a graphical representation of points. Coordinates can also be viewed by hovering over a point.
